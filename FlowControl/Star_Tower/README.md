# Nine-Level Star Tower (Java)

This project prints a nine-level star tower using Java.  
Each level contains an odd number of `*` characters (1, 3, 5, 7, …), centered to form a pyramid-like structure.  
It is a simple console program created as part of my Java learning practice.

## Features
- Adjustable tower height (default: 9 levels)
- Centered star pattern
- Uses nested loops to control spacing and star count

## Example Output (9 levels)
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
   ***********
  *************
 ***************

## How to Run
